### Setting Values

You can set the addon field type value with an addon's namespace:

    $entry->example = "anomaly.module.files"

You can also set the value with an instance of an addon:

    $entry->example = $module;

Lastly you can set the value with an instance of an addon presenter:

    $entry->example = $decorated;
